# Test Plan

## Scope
- API endpoints (admin, user, product, order, payment)
- UI: Wallet connection, navigation, gameplay, error handling, and user flows

## Objectives
- Verify all critical user and admin flows work as intended
- Ensure protected resources are not accessible without authentication
- Confirm UI elements and flows are present and functional
- Validate error handling and edge cases
- Check for security vulnerabilities (hardcoded secrets, unvalidated API usage, dependency issues)

## Test Types
- Functional Testing (API & UI)
- Security Testing (API protection, wallet connection, secret management)
- Usability Testing (UI flows, error messages)
- Edge Case Testing (invalid input, unauthorized access, wallet disconnect)

## Tools
- Playwright (API & UI automation)
- Manual browser testing

## Test Cases

### Edge Cases

- **Play game with zero balance:**  
  Pass. You cannot play with insufficient funds, but no error message is shown.

- **Submit malformed API requests:**  
  Pass. Example: Accessing `http://localhost:4002/dices` returns "Game not found! ðŸ‘Ž".

- **Try admin endpoints with regular user token:**  
  Fail. Gameplay is determined by user balance, not authorization. Token is created upon wallet connection, but games are playable without wallet connection. No authorization policy enforced.

- **Try to play a game with wallet disconnected:**  
  Fail. Games are playable without wallet connection; no authorization policy enforced.

## Summary

- Test Plan: Covers both API and UI, with clear objectives and tools.
- Test Cases: Updated to reflect current implementation, including all tested routes and realistic scenarios.
- Status: Some critical issues found (API protection, security, error handling, dependency management, unvalidated API usage).
